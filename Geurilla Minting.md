# SOLspace Guerrilla Minting: Technical Deep Dive

## How It Works: Detailed Process Flow

### 1. Automated Detection System
- **Continuous Monitoring**
  - Real-time Twitter API integration
  - Processing up to 10,000 posts monthly
  - Smart rate limiting to maximize API usage
  - 15-minute scan intervals

- **Viral Prediction Algorithm**
  - Multi-factor engagement analysis
    * Raw metrics (likes, retweets, replies)
    * Velocity tracking (engagement per hour)
    * Acceleration measurement (rate of change)
  - Content categorization
    * Hashtag analysis
    * Media presence detection
    * URL and mention tracking

- **Tiered Qualification System**
  - Tier 1 (Rising) Thresholds:
    * 1,000+ likes OR
    * 200+ retweets OR
    * 100 likes/hour velocity
  - Tier 2 (Trending) Thresholds:
    * 2,500+ likes OR
    * 500+ retweets OR
    * 250 likes/hour velocity
  - Tier 3 (Viral) Thresholds:
    * 5,000+ likes OR
    * 1,000+ retweets OR
    * 500 likes/hour velocity

### 2. Instant Preservation Process
