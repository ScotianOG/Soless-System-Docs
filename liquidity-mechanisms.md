# SOLspace NFT Liquidity Mechanisms

## Instant Liquidity Through SOLarium
SOLspace NFT holders have multiple paths to access liquidity:

### Direct Floor Redemption
When you need immediate liquidity, your NFT can be redeemed directly through SOLarium at its floor price. This process is:
- Instant and automated
- Guaranteed at floor value
- No need to find buyers
- No slippage or market impact

### Collateral Borrowing
Rather than selling, NFT holders can use their assets as collateral:
- Borrow up to 70% of floor value
- Maintain NFT ownership and benefits
- Flexible repayment terms
- Interest rates based on tier status

### Trading Options
For those seeking market-based returns:
- List above floor price on SOLspace marketplace
- Floor price acts as automatic buy order
- No risk of selling below established value
- Maintain Genesis benefits until sale

### Smart Liquidity Features
The system includes protective mechanisms:
- Automated floor price adjustments based on market conditions
- Gradual unlocking of borrowed value to prevent market impact
- Priority liquidity access for Genesis holders
- Emergency liquidity pool for market stress scenarios

This multi-layered approach ensures that NFT holders always have access to value while maintaining the option to benefit from market upside and historical significance appreciation.
